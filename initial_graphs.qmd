#### Cleaning Data
```{r}
# reads in data
pbp <- read.csv("play_by_play.csv")

#
rm_col <- c("wctimestring", "player1_team_city", "player2_team_city",
            "player3_team_city", "video_available_flag")

pbp <- pbp[, -which(names(pbp) %in% rm_col)]

cols <- c("game_id", "eventnum", "eventmsgtype", "eventmsgactiontype",
          "period", "wctimestring", "pctimestring", "score")

no_missing <- complete.cases(pbp[, cols])
pbp <- pbp[no_missing, ]

pbp <- unique(pbp)

#ensure types are correct in every column of importance


#create new column parsing shot distance




```


#### All possible configs

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE
#| label: fig-charts
#| fig-cap: "Charts of Two Datasets Provided by R"
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-subcap:
