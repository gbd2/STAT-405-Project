Create six high quality plots using ggplot2 (exclusively). The plots have to be of different kind, (also different types regarding the ones done with base graphics). This report should include 12 plots (the ones in draft 1 and the six new).
Please include narrative for each of them, introducing the plots and interpreting what they display.
Take the opportunity to start adding more material to your report. Also, you could improve (or replace) older plots if possible (or if you got feedback on them).
Submit your source file (qmd or Rnw according to your case) together with the pdf file.
As drafts evolve, apply feedback received for prior project report drafts, aiming at more professional drafts.
